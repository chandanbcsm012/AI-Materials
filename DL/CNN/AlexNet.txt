Alex Krizhevsky created a neural network architecture called ‘AlexNet’ and won Image Classification Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012. They trained their network on 1.2 million high-resolution images into 1000 different classes with 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons. The training was done on two GPUs with split layer concept because GPUs were a little bit slow at that time.

AlexNet is a 8 layer convolutional neural network architecture which consists of Convolutional layers, Activation layers, Max Pooling layers and Dense layers. It has 5 convolutional layers, 3 max pooling layers, and 3 dense layers with one output dense-softmax layer.
