Convolutional Neural Network:
-----------------------------
It is another type of neural network which is best suitable for image classification.

Problem with fully connected neural network:
--------------------------------------------
1.if image size is 100x100,i.e 10000 features in input layer and if a hidden layer contains 10 neurons i.e. each neuron will receive 10000 features +10000 weights
i.e. we need 100000 weights now consider other hidden layers with neorons.In nutshell, network will update lacks of weights in each epoch which is quite time taking and not real in practical.

(In CNN,weights are shared so less weights need to update in each epoch)

2.we pass image as image format(either gray or colored) directly.
(information of image is not lost)



What is a Convolution?
----------------------
In mathematics, convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions that produces a third function expressing how the shape of one is modified by the other. The term convolution refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it.

In image processing,first function is a part of an image and other function is kernal or filter & output of convolution is also known as Feature Map.

There are so many standard filters that finds edges and other features from an image.


Steps in CNN:
-------------
1.obtain convolutions from an image 
2.add bias
3.pass convolutions to ReLU 
4.use pooling
5.use fully connected layer

in step-1,we may use padding to get importance of boundary pixels and it will also
use to make same shape of the convolutional image as original image.

in step-1,we may also use stride(step) ,which is default to 1,to decide how to take
convolutional.

if original image shape is (n x n),filter is (m x m) then convolutional image shape will be 
	((n-m+2p)/stride)+1


in pooling we may also use stride and padding
