>ImageNet is a large dataset of annotated photographs intended for computer vision research

>It contains 10 millions(1 crore) images with 10000 categories

>The images vary in dimensions and resolution. Many applications resize / crop all of the images to 256x256 pixels or 224x224.

>The largest image is 4288 x 2848 pixels. The smallest image is 75 x 56 pixels.

>All Images are colored.

>ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC):is an annual competition held between 2010 and 2017 on a subset of Imagenet dataset(1.2 million images with 1000 categories)

>The training data, the subset of ImageNet containing the 1000 categories and 1.2 million images.

> 50,000 of the images with 1000 categories as validation data

> 150,000 of the images with 1000 categories as test data



>There are some authors who developed their CNNs for subset of Imagenet
	>AlexNet
	>VGG
	>GoogleNet
	>ResNet
	>DenseNet
	etc.
