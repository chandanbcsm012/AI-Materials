Keras:
======
>Keras is an open-source deep learning library written in Python.

>It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, or PlaidML.

>In 2019, Google released a new version of their TensorFlow deep learning library (TensorFlow 2) that integrated the Keras API

>This integration is commonly referred to as the tf.keras interface or API (“tf” is short for “TensorFlow“)

Now the term Keras means:
	>Standalone Keras: The standalone open source project that supports 			   TensorFlow, Theano and CNTK backends.

	>tf.keras: The Keras API integrated into TensorFlow 2.


Deep Learning Model Life-Cycle using Keras:
-------------------------------------------
1.Define the model.
2.Compile the model.
3.Fit the model.
4.Evaluate the model.
5.Make predictions.


1.Define the model.
	>select API type of model (Sequential or Functional)
	>adding layers
	>defining activation function,initializing weights,input shape

2.Compile the model.
	>select optimizer
	>select loss function to optimize
	>select metrics for score

3.Fit the model.
	>specify training set
	>specify epochs
	>optional batch_size

4.Evaluate the model.
	>test the model with testset

5.Make predictions.
	>finally make prediction on real time data


Sequential Model API:
---------------------
>It is the simplest way to define deep neural network

>It is referred to as “sequential” because it involves defining a Sequential class and adding layers to the model one by one in a linear manner, from input to output.

Functional Model API:
---------------------
In Sequential API ,layers automatically get input as output from previous layers,it means we can not use output of a layer in other models because we dont have reference of this input /output

Functional API address this problem.
