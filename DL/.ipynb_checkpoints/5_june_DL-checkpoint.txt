Terminology used in Neural Network:
-----------------------------------
>Layers
	>Input Layer
	>Hidden Layers
	>Output Layer
>Neurons
	>A Neuron=Linear model+Activation function
>Activation Function
	>transform linear model into specific intervals
>loss function
>Optimizers
>feedfoward
>back propagation
>chain rule of partial derivative

Single Layer neural network:
----------------------------
>Input Layer
>Output Layer

Note:Such NN is also known as perceptron

Two or more Layers neural network:
----------------------------
>Input Layer
>Hidden Layers
>Output Layer

Note:Such NN is also known as MLP(Multi layer perceptron)
MLP is also known as Deep Neural Network
