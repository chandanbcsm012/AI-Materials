How LinearRegression works internally:
--------------------------------------
>It uses equation of line to find relationship between independent and
dependent variable
	y=mx+b  

>LR needs to find or learn the value of parameters(m and b) using training data.
	lr.fit(X_train,y_train)

>let's suppose
	m=5000
	b=3000

now equation becomes:
	y=5000x+3000  #this is known as model


Difference between Algorithm and Model:
----------------------------------------
>Algorithm uses standard mathmatical equation to solve a problem
in this equation ,there might be some parameters that need to be learned
	exp:

	y= mx+ b  is a mathematical equation with parameters m,b

algorithm needs to learn these paramters from training data

	now if algorith has find values of m and b

	m=5000
	b=3000

now equ becomes:
	y=5000x+3000

	now this is known as model
