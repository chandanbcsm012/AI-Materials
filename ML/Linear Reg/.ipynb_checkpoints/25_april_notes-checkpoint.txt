Underfitting:
	>high bias i.e. poor score on seen data

why underfitting:
	>features are not scaled
	>less no. of features
	etc.
solution of underfitting:
	>PolynomialFeatures

Overfitting:
	>high variance i.e. model is only sensitive to seen data
	or poor with unseen data.

why overfitting:
	>features are not scaled
	>too many features	

solution:
	>Regularization
		>Ridge
		>Lasso
		etc.
