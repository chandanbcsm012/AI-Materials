Ensemble(group) Learning:
	>it is a technique that combines multiple weak learners(models) into one
	 strong learner to predict the final output.

	>there are two types of ensemble learning
		>Bagging
		>Boosting

Bagging:
--------
	>training set is divided into multiple subsets using random splitting with replacement approach.
	>for each subset a seperate model is created either using same
algo or different algo.
	>test sample is passed to each model for prediction
	>voting is used in classification and avg is used in regression.
	
	>sklearn supports following algos :
		same base estimator
			>RandomForestClassifier
			>RandomForestRegressor
			>BaggingClassifier
			>BaggingRegressor
		different estimators
			>VotingClassifier
			>VotingRegressor
			etc.
