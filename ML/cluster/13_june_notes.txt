K-Means:
--------
	>it is one of the unsupervise algo that groups similar samples into clusters

Working of k-means:
-------------------
>decide no of clusters(say k)
Run-1
	>pick k points of training set as centroid of clusters

	Iteration-1
		>calculate distances of all training points with these centroid
		>assign training points to a specific cluster based on distances
		>again compute new centroids by taking means of samples that lie in same 			cluster
	Iteration-2
		>calculate distances of all training points with these centroid
		>assign training points to a specific cluster based on distances
		>again compute new centroids by taking means of samples that lie in same 			cluster
	.
	.
	.
	until max_iteration or unchanged centroid in two consecutive iterations

Run-2
	>pick different k points of training set as centroid of clusters

	Iteration-1
		>calculate distances of all training points with these centroid
		>assign training points to a specific cluster based on distances
		>again compute new centroids by taking means of samples that lie in same 			cluster
	Iteration-2
		>calculate distances of all training points with these centroid
		>assign training points to a specific cluster based on distances
		>again compute new centroids by taking means of samples that lie in same 			cluster
	.

How to find best value for no. of clusters
------------------------------------------
>there are multiple techniques for this concept and elbow technique is one of them


Computer Vision:
----------------
	>it is technique to process the images/videos before given to model.
	>opencv and dlib are commonly used libraries for computer vision
OpenCv:
-------
	>first released in 2000 by Gary Bradsky.
	>supports c++,java,python
	>pip install opencv-python
	>cv2 is module name

cv2.IMREAD_COLOR	1 (default)Transparency is neglected
cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE	0
cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED	-1



How to display image:
---------------------

cv2.imshow('window_name',image)#auto size and not responsive with window

cv2.namedWindow('window_name',cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL) #make image responsive
cv2.imshow('window_name',image)

Note:in both cases window will be displayed and closed very fast.

cv2.waitKey(time_in_milis):it is a keyboard binding function and holds window till given time.

cv2.waitKey(0):means wait indefinitely untill any key is pressed


How to close window:
--------------------
Note:close button of window make window invisible not destroy it

cv2.destroyWindow('window_name') :close specified window

cv2.destroyAllWindows():close all windows



How to resize image:
--------------------

resize_img=resize(img,(w,h))


How to draw text and shapes in image:
-------------------------------------
cv2.line(img,(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(B,G,R),thickness)
default value of thickness is 1,-1 means fill shape

cv2.rectangle(img,(top_left_x,top_left_y),(bottom_right_x,bottom_right_y),(B,G,R),thick)

cv2.circle(img,center(x,y),radius,thick)

cv2.putText(img,'text',bottom_left(x,y),font_type,font_size,color,thick,line_type)































































EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis):
===============================
	>It is a statistical way to perform primary investigation on data before going
	detailed study.
	>It provides various statistical characterstics of data like:
		>mean
		>median
		>mode
		>max
		>min
		>std
		>count
		etc.
	>We may also visualize EDA using matplotlib & seaborn libraries
	>In pandas,we have following methods to perform EDA
		>info()
		>describe()
		>groupby()
		>etc.


Data Preprocessing:
------------------
	>handling missing values
	>handling duplicacy
	>data cleaning
	>data encoding
		>converting categorical col to numeric
			>label encoding   (ordinal to numeric)
			>one hot encoding (nominal to numeric)
