NLP(Natural Language Processing):
=================================
>it is a technique that enables human interaction with machines in natural(human) 
languages.

Applications of NLP
	>text classification(ML)
	Deep Learning(neural network)
	>chat bot
	>speech recognition
	>NMT(natural/neural machine translation)
	etc.

Implementation of NLP:
----------------------
there are multiple libraries that can be used to implement NLP
>nltk(natural language toolkit)
>Gensim
>TextBlob
>spaCy
etc.


Steps in Text classification:
-----------------------------
	>Text cleaning
	>Feature Extraction
	>model building
	>make prediction

Text cleaning:
--------------
	>remove punctuation
	>convert all text in same case(lower/upper)
	>remove stop words
	>stemming / lemmetization

	wife,wives------->stem------->wife,wive
	wife,wives------->lem------->wife,wife

Feature Extraction:
-------------------
	>it is a process of extracting features from whole text
	>there are multiple approaches to extract features
		>Bag of words technique
		>Tf-Idf technique
		>one hot vector technique
		>word embedings

Model building:
----------------
	>create model by fitting feature matrix and target
	>naive bayes algos is recommended for text classification because of fast computation	
prediction:
	>use test sample to classify it.
