PCA(Principal Component Analysis):
----------------------------------
	>it is a dim. reduction technique that trasformed original dataset to new dataset
in such a manner ,first dim. contains most of the information of dataset,and so on.

	>here,newly generated features are known as Principal Components
	>you can think principal component as mixture of original features
	>bydefault it generates same number of principal components as the no. of features
in original dataset.
	>we may use first 2-3 (or based on most of the information) pc to build thge model.

Note:there are other techniques also for Dimensionlity Reduction like LDA,SVD,etc.


	>from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

How PCA works internally:
-------------------------
step-1
	>use standard scalar to scale original features
step-2
	>compute covariance matrix of features

step-3
	>compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors from cov-matrix

step-4
	>take transpose of eigen vectors
step-5
	>select first n eigenvectors based on their eigen values
step-6
	>again take transpose of selected eigen vectors
step-7
	>take dot product with scaled features(original)
